== Introduction

== Building from source
After you've downloaded the code from GitHub, you can build it using Gradle. Use this command:
---- 
gradle clean build
----
 
The generated jar files can be found at: `build/libs/`.

An uber jar containing the library and all its relocated dependencies can also be built. Use this command: 
----
gradle clean shadowJar
----

The generated uber jar file can also be found at: `build/libs/`.
 
=== Validating secure dependencies
To ensure no security vulnerabilities in the dependency libraries, run the following.
----
gradle dependencyCheckAnalyze
----

If the above reports any vulnerabilities, upgrade dependencies to use the respective latest versions.
